(A) Introduction
=================

The data provided by this FATE corpus release add a layer of role-semantic
information to the test dataset of the Second Recognizing Textual Entailment
(RTE) Challenge, consisting of 800 Text-Hypothesis entailment pairs.
More information about the original corpus and about the Challenge can be 
found here:

http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE2

The role-semantic annotation follows the Berkeley FrameNet paradigm:

http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu

using the frames of FrameNet release 1.3. 
The corpus is pre-processed using the Collins parser.

The annotation scheme and process are fully described in:

(B) Corpus Format
===================

The format of the corpus is in SALSA/TIGER XML, documented in:

K. Erk and S. Padó
A powerful and versatile XML Format for representing role-semantic annotation
Proceedings of LREC-2004, Lisbon.
(http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/%7Epado/pub/papers/lrec04_erk.pdf)

Please refer ot Section.3 of the above paper for a complete analysis of the
tag-set in use in FATE. 
Text-Hypothesis pairs are ordered by Id, starting from Id=1 and ending with 
id=800. Each sentence, of either the Text or the Hypothesis is identified by 
the tag <s>. For example, the pair with id=24 has a Text composed by two sentences,
and a Hypothesis composed by one sentence. The order and the ids of the sentences
is then the following: 
<s id="24_t_0">
<s id="24_t_1">
<s id="24_h_0">


(C) Useful Software
===================

SALSA also provides a graphical user interface, SALTO, for viewing and
modifying semantic role annotation, available from:

This page also lists other related software.
