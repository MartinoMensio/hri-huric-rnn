Riporto di seguito una descrizione in inglese con altre informazioni che spero possano essere utile. 

HuRIC is a collection of examples of commands, annotated with Frame Semantics
predicates and morphs-syntactic information (POS-tag, dependency tree, ...).

However, together with the corpus, we developed a Spoken Language Understanding system called
LU4R, based on a cascade of sequential labelers, whose models have been trained over HuRIC.
It has been designed also for a context-aware interpretation of spoken commands, consistently with
the paper presented at IJCAI2016:
https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/16/Papers/390.pdf

More details on LU4R can be found here: http://sag.art.uniroma2.it/lu4r.html

If you are interested in playing with LU4R, it can be dowloaded at this
